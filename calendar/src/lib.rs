//! This is a library containing nn extremely simple Date object. The
//! purpose is to help perform Building Performance calculations, so it only
//! contains month, day and hour (in decimals). **It does not consider years at all**, 
//! days and Months are counted from 1 (e.g. January is 1, not 0). 
//! We don't need anything else, I think.
//! 
//! # Interaction with Serde
//! 
//! You can enable the `serde` feature and do stuff like this:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! use calendar::Date;
//! use serde_json; // import "serde_json" and enable feature "serde"
//! 
//! let v = r#"{"month": 9,"day": 4, "hour": 21}"#;
//! let d : Date = serde_json::from_str(&v).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(d.month, 9);
//! assert_eq!(d.day, 4);
//! assert!((d.hour - 21.).abs() < 1e-5);
//! ```
//! 
//! # Interaction with Chrono
//! 
//! You can enable the `chrono` feature and do stuff like this
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! use chrono::NaiveDateTime; // enable feature "chrono"
//! use calendar::Date;
//!        
//! let v = "2014-11-28T21:00:09+09:00";
//! let chrono_datetime  = NaiveDateTime::parse_from_str(&v, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z").unwrap();
//! 
//! let d : Date = chrono_datetime.into();
//! assert_eq!(d.month, 11);
//! assert_eq!(d.day, 28);
//! assert!((d.hour - 21.0025).abs() < 1e-5, "hour is {}", d.hour);
//! ```

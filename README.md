Thanks for your interest in `SIMPLE`, a simulation tool aiming to
satisfy the present needs of Building Performance Simulation. Long story short,
`SIMPLE` aims to:

1. Allow for a holistic building performance simulation using best-practice
algorithms for each domain
2. Make it easier to account for the complex interactions between Humans
and Buildings
3. Make it possible to implement complex algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control.
4. Be deployable in multiple environments, including Windows, Linux and Mac, the cloud, the browser (i.e., WebAssembly)
5. Use modern languages, toolset, and aim for clarity of source code (I do my best...)

You can read more about this in the
["Do we need `SIMPLE`?"](https://germolinal.github.io/simple_docs/ioreference/book/what_is_simple.html)  section of the docs


## Examples

### Runs everywhere

Check [THIS LINK](https://buildingsforpeople.org/simple_demo/) to see `SIMPLE` running on your browser. No servers involved.

### Holistic simulation

Here is an example of Holistic simulations. Check these images, showcasing how 
`SIMPLE` can perform lighting and thermal simulation.

## Documentation

I am hoping that the first people who get here are those niche humans who
nerd about buulding simulation, coding, and more. If you are 
one of them, please help me write tutorials and docs and all that. People who do 
Buildings do not often do programming.

This project aims to make the world better. Use it as much as you can and want. 
Just respect the license and do not blame me if there is anything wrong, or
incomplete, or anything else... I developed this whole code myself, so do not

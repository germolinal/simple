    ///
    /// The Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity ($`IR_h`$) should formally be calculated
    /// as $`\sigma \times T^4_{sky}`$ (where $`\sigma`$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $`T_{sky}`$
    /// is the sky temperature). This has historically been approximated through the following equation:
    ///
    /// ```math
    /// IR_h = \epsilon_{sky} \sigma  T^4_{dry bulb}
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Where $`\epsilon_{sky}`$ can be calculated from the clear-sky emmisivity ($`\epsilon_{sky, clear}`$)
    /// based on the opaque sky cover $`N`$ as follows
    ///
    /// ```math
    /// \epsilon_{sky} = \epsilon_{sky, clear} \left( 1 + 0.0224 N - 0.0035 N^2 + 0.00028 N^3 \right)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Then, EnergyPlus offers 4 correlations... `SIMPLE` utilizes EnergyPlus' default one, which is
    /// the one called Clark & Allen in that reference. This correlation is the following:
    ///
    /// ```math
    /// \epsilon_{sky, clear} = 0.787 + 0.764 ln \left( \frac{T_{dewpoint}}{273} \right)
    /// ```

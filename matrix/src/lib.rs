//! A Library for Generic Matrix operations.
//!
//! It is built generically (i.e., `GenericMatrix<T: TReq>` where `TReq` is a
//! basic numeric Trait) so that the same library can be used for defining Matrices
//! over `usize`, `i32`, `f32` and even structures (e.g., `Colour{red:f32, green: f32, blue: f32}`)
//! to which numeric operations apply

/// The kind of Ting point number used in the
/// library... the `"T"` feature means it becomes `f32`
/// and `f64` is used otherwise.
#[cfg(feature = "float")]
type Float = f32;

/// The kind of Ting point number used in the
/// library... the `"T"` feature means it becomes `f32`
/// and `f64` is used otherwise.
